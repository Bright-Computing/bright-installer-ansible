# Bright Cluster head node installer Ansible collection examples

This repository contains usage examples for the `brightcomputing.installer100` Ansible collection.

To immediately jump to one of the example Playbooks, see

- [Azure](playbooks/azure/)
- [Non-cloud](/playbooks/non-cloud)

The remainder of this document provides a high-level overview of the installer Ansible collection.

## Introduction

An Ansible collection is the standard way for shipping and consuming Ansible distributables (playbooks, roles, plugins) since version 2.10. This document assumes that the user has practical knowledge of Ansible and Bright Cluster Manager.

This document briefly describes the procedure for deploying a Bright Cluster head node through an Ansible playbook using the head node installer Ansible collection. The collection defines the `brightcomputing.installer100.head_node` role that deploys the Bright Cluster Manager head node when defined with the correct parameters in the userâ€™s playbooks and roles. The head node installation also includes deployment of the default software image and node-installer image components, which is required for provisioning compute nodes.

## Terminology

Throughout this document, **control node** refers to the machine from where the Ansible playbook is being run and where the Ansible collection is installed. Managed node or **host** refers to the machine where the Bright head node is being deployed.

## Supported versions
Linux distributions:
* Rocky Linux 8
* Rocky Linux 9
* Redhat Enterprise Linux 8
* Redhat Enterprise Linux 9
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

## Using this collection

### Requirements

*See the [Ansible Galaxy README](https://galaxy.ansible.com/brightcomputing/installer100) for a comprehensive overview of requirements.*

In short, there are several configuration requirements for target host machines.

- [Minimal hardware requirements](https://support.brightcomputing.com/manuals/10.0/installation-manual.pdf#section.3.1)
- Fresh installation  of a [supported Linux distribution ](#supported-versions)
- Software
  - Python 3 and required modules
  - MySQL or MariaDB service
  - SELinux disabled
- Access to Bright software
  - **local**: using a manually defined repository
  - **network**: using a repository defined by Bright packages
  - **dvd**: using an ISO file or DVD

### Installation

Install the collection using the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install brightcomputing.installer100
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

### Running the head node installer

The head node installer collection can be referenced by its name in a Playbook. Assign the `head_node` role to a host pattern in order to use the installer.

```yaml
- name: <play name>
  hosts: <pattern>
  roles:
    - role: brightcomputing.installer100.head_node
      vars:
        <parameters>
```

### Parameters

*See the [Ansible Galaxy README](https://galaxy.ansible.com/brightcomputing/installer100) for a comprehensive overview of parameters.*

There are mandatory parameters related to the product license.

| Parameter | Type/Format | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| product_key | XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX | A Bright Computing product key used to request a license for the deployment |
| license.country | string | The country value to use for the certificate request |
| license.state | string  | The state or province name to use for the certificate request |
| license.locality | string | The locality name to use for the certificate request |
| license.organization | string | The organization name to use for the certificate request|
| license.organizational_unit | string | The organization unit name to use for the certificate request |
| license.cluster_name | string | The cluster name (common name) name to use for the certificate request |
| license.mac | mac | The mac address value to use for the certificate request |

There are also mandatory credential parameters. It is strongly recommended to manage these (and similar parameters) using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-vault.html).

| Parameter | Type/Format | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| db_cmd_password | string | CMDaemon service database password |
| ldap_root_pass | string | LDAP root password to configure ldap service with|
| ldap_readonly_pass | string | LDAP read only password to configure ldap service with|
| slurm_user_pass | string | SLURM user password for database access |

Furthermore, there are connectivity-related parameters. `management_interface` needs to be set for all types of cloud deployment. Depending on the platform (AWS, Azure, non-cloud), there are additional mandatory parameters. See the specific examples for details.

| Parameter | Type/Format | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| management_interface | string | The head node management network interface  |

And then there are install medium parameters. Depending on the choice of install medium (dvd, network, or local), there are different mandatory parameters to be specified.

| Parameter | Type/Format | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| install_medium |  choice of [dvd, network, local] | Medium type that the installer will use for the installation of Bright |
| **dvd** | | |
| install_medium_dvd_path | path | Path to Bright-provided iso or path to device with the DVD on it |
| install_medium_dvd_checksum_path | path | Path to file containing md5 checksum of Bright iso (optional)|
| **network** | | |
| install_medium_network_packages | list[string] | List of paths to all packages provided by Bright that will define Bright Package repositories |
| **local** | | |
| install_medium_local_repo_path | path | Path to local file that defines the list of package repositories to fetch Bright package from |

All example playbooks in this repository use the network install medium. When basing a playbook on the examples, be sure to set correct paths for the `cm-config` packages, matching the operating system and architecture. Verify that these network locations are reachable from the target host.

## Examples

The example playbooks in this repository specify simple installations for the three cloud types: AWS, Azure, and non-cloud. Their configuration is similar, but every type also requires unique parameters. The cloud type is determined by the `cloud` parameter.

The examples assume that the necessary machines are present and prepared according to the requirements as specified in the [Ansible Galaxy README](https://galaxy.ansible.com/brightcomputing/installer100). This means that in the case of a non-cloud installation, there are live machines reachable from the control node, and in case of a cloud deployment, the respective resources are provisioned beforehand. For the latter, the cloud resources can of course be provisioned using the AWS and Azure Ansible playbooks.

This repository contains three example playbooks.

- [AWS](playbooks/aws/)
- [Azure](playbooks/azure/)
- [Non-cloud](/playbooks/non-cloud)
