# Bright Cluster head node installer Ansible collection

This repository contains the `brightcomputing.installer` Ansible collection. It includes the `brightcomputing.installer.head_node` role for deploying Bright Cluster Manager head nodes.

## Introduction

An Ansible collection is the standard way for shipping and consuming Ansible distributables (playbooks, roles, plugins) since version 2.10. This document assumes that the user has practical knowledge of Ansible and Bright Cluster Manager.

This document describes the procedure for deploying a Bright Cluster head node through an Ansible playbook using the head node installer Ansible collection. The collection defines the `brightcomputing.installer.head_node` role that deploys the Bright Cluster Manager head node when defined with the correct parameters in the userâ€™s playbooks and roles. The head node installation also includes deployment of the default software image and node-installer image components, which is required for provisioning compute nodes.

## Terminology

Throughout this document, **control node** refers to the machine from where the Ansible playbook is being run and where the Ansible collection is installed. Managed node or **host** refers to the machine where the Bright head node is being deployed.
