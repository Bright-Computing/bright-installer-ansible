- [Non-cloud](/playbooks/non-cloud)

The remainder of this document provides a high-level overview of the installer Ansible collection.

## Introduction

An Ansible collection is the standard way for shipping and consuming Ansible distributables (playbooks, roles, plugins) since version 2.10. This document assumes that the user has practical knowledge of Ansible and Bright Cluster Manager.

This document briefly describes the procedure for deploying a Bright Cluster head node through an Ansible playbook using the head node installer Ansible collection. The collection defines the `brightcomputing.installer.head_node` role that deploys the Bright Cluster Manager head node when defined with the correct parameters in the userâ€™s playbooks and roles. The head node installation also includes deployment of the default software image and node-installer image components, which is required for provisioning compute nodes.

## Terminology

Throughout this document, **control node** refers to the machine from where the Ansible playbook is being run and where the Ansible collection is installed. Managed node or **host** refers to the machine where the Bright head node is being deployed.

## Supported versions
Linux distributions:
* Rocky Linux 8.5
* Redhat Enterprise Linux 8.5
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

Bright versions:
* Bright Cluster Manager 9.2

## Using this collection

### Requirements

*See the [Ansible Galaxy README](https://galaxy.ansible.com/brightcomputing/installer) for a comprehensive overview of requirements.*

### Installation

Install the collection using the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install brightcomputing.installer
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

### Running the head node installer

The head node installer collection can be referenced by its name in a Playbook. Assign the `head_node` role to a host pattern in order to use the installer.

```yaml
- name: <play name>
  hosts: <pattern>
  roles:
    - role: brightcomputing.installer.head_node
      vars:
        <parameters>
```
